            <h2>Reasons to <em>watch</em></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The main plotline is about the relationship between Jim, the saleman, and Pam, the recptionist. It's a slow burn and well made to make you want to keep watching as theyre friendship grows throughout the show.</li>
           <br>
            <li>The humour. Honestly the best part of the show is how funny it is. I've seen every episode atleast 5 times and I laugh every time.</li> <br>
            <ul>The show is made in the format of a documentary</ul>
